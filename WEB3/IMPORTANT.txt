To implement and run the Instagram Basic Display API integration in your `testimonials.html` (as provided in the updated code), you don't need any additional libraries or external dependencies—it's all vanilla JavaScript using the browser's built-in `fetch` API. However, you'll need to set up the Meta (Facebook) developer account, obtain credentials, and make a few replacements in the code. Below is a complete, step-by-step guide to get it running. This assumes your Instagram account is public and set to Business/Creator mode (switch via Instagram Settings > Account > Switch to Professional Account).

### What You'll Need
1. **Meta Developer Account**: Free, but requires a Facebook login.
2. **Instagram Business/Creator Account**: Linked to your Facebook Page.
3. **Access Token and User ID**: Generated during setup (long-lived token lasts ~60 days).
4. **No Server/Backend**: Runs client-side in the browser, so it's easy for static sites like yours.
5. **Basic Tools**: A code editor (e.g., VS Code) and a local server (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code) to test.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
#### 1. **Set Up Your Facebook App (One-Time, ~10-15 Minutes)**
   - Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com) and log in with your Facebook account.
   - Click **My Apps** > **Create App**.
     - Select **Consumer** app type.
     - Enter app name (e.g., "ShreesCleanX Testimonials") and your email.
     - Click **Create App**.
   - In the app dashboard, click **Add Product** > Search for "Instagram Basic Display" > **Set Up**.
   - Under **Instagram Basic Display** settings:
     - Click **Create New App** if prompted.
     - Enter your Instagram username (e.g., @shreescleanx) and link it to your Facebook Page.
     - Click **Authorize** to connect your Instagram account.
   - Note your **App ID** and **App Secret** from the app dashboard (Settings > Basic). You'll need the secret for token exchange.

#### 2. **Generate Access Token and User ID**
   - In the Instagram Basic Display settings, click **Generate Token** (or "Basic Display" > "Generate Token").
     - Authorize the app—this gives a short-lived token (~1 hour).
   - Exchange for a long-lived token (use a tool like Postman or curl in terminal):
     ```
     curl -X GET "https://graph.instagram.com/access_token?grant_type=ig_exchange_token&client_secret=YOUR_APP_SECRET&access_token=SHORT_LIVED_TOKEN"
     ```
     - Replace `YOUR_APP_SECRET` with your app secret.
     - Replace `SHORT_LIVED_TOKEN` with the token from step above.
     - Response: JSON with `access_token` (long-lived) and `user_id` (your Instagram numeric ID, e.g., 17841401234567890).
   - Save these: `access_token` and `user_id`.

#### 3. **Update the Code in `testimonials.html`**
   - Open `testimonials.html` in your code editor.
   - In the `<script>` section, replace the placeholders:
     ```javascript
     const token = 'IGQV...your_long_lived_token_here'; // Paste your long-lived access token
     const userId = '1234567890'; // Paste your Instagram User ID
     ```
   - Optional: Customize the filter in the script:
     - Change `post.caption.toLowerCase().includes('shree') || post.caption.includes('#ShreesCleanX')` to match your testimonial keywords (e.g., add `'love'` or `'recommend'`).
   - Save the file.

#### 4. **Test Locally**
   - Install a local server if needed (e.g., VS Code Live Server extension or Python: `python -m http.server` in your project folder).
   - Open `testimonials.html` in a browser (e.g., http://localhost:5500/testimonials.html).
   - Check:
     - "Loading testimonials..." appears briefly.
     - Dynamic cards load with images, usernames, captions, and links.
     - If no posts match the filter, it shows a fallback message.
   - Open DevTools (F12 > Console) for errors:
     - "Invalid token": Regenerate token.
     - "No data": Post a test Instagram post mentioning "Shree" or #ShreesCleanX, then refresh.
     - CORS errors: Rare for this API, but test on a hosted site (e.g., GitHub Pages) if local fails.

#### 5. **Deploy and Maintain**
   - Upload `testimonials.html` and `/css/styles.css` to your web host (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).
   - Token expires in ~60 days: Set a calendar reminder to regenerate (repeat Step 2).
   - To automate: Use a simple cron job on a server or a service like Zapier to refresh the token.
   - Add fallback static testimonials: In the script, if `testimonials.length === 0`, append your original static divs as backup.

### Potential Issues & Fixes
- **Private Account**: API only works for public posts. Make your account public.
- **No Testimonials**: Encourage customers to tag @shreescleanx in posts. Test by posting yourself.
- **API Limits**: 200 calls/hour free. If exceeded, wait 1 hour.
- **Stories**: This API doesn't fetch Stories (use Graph API for Business accounts; requires more setup).
- **Security**: Don't commit the token to public GitHub—use environment variables if building a backend.
- **Customization**: To show more posts, change `slice(0, 4)` to `slice(0, 6)`. For videos, add `<video>` tag if `media_type === 'VIDEO'`.

This will make your testimonials dynamic and pull live from Instagram. If you run into errors (e.g., during token generation), share the exact message or console log, and I'll debug!
